/// The CAPTCHA fallback, at the level the student sees it.
///
/// ## Why this is a widget test
///
/// The defect was a **wiring** one, and it was invisible to the domain
/// tests: the session manager posted the student's digits against a challenge
/// it had fetched itself, so every correct answer was refused by the portal.
///
/// The chain that has to work is: the solver declines → the student is asked →
/// the digits they type reach the portal **in the session the image came
/// from** → the login succeeds → the dashboard shows the account.
///
/// The session is the part that matters. The portal judges the answer against
/// the session the image was fetched in, and it mints a new session whenever
/// it renders the login page, so an answer posted in the wrong session is
/// refused however correct the digits are. Verified live 2026-10-21 (F77).
