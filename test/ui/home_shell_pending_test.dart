/// The shell's answer to the platform's own requests, at the level the user
/// sees it.
///
/// ## The defect
///
/// The platform can ask the Dart side to do things at moments when there is
/// no Dart side to ask:
///
///   * a **hunt** wake-up, fired by an alarm with the app killed;
///   * a **reboot**, fired by `BootReceiver` — and at boot the process is by
///     definition dead, so this one could never arrive even in principle.
///
/// Both were delivered through the method channel, whose other end only
/// exists while the activity is alive. The service started, posted its
/// notification claiming the basket was being watched, and told nobody. The
/// reboot receiver existed, was correctly declared, and re-armed nothing.
///
/// So the native side records the requests now, and the shell answers them
/// when it next runs. These tests are about the shell doing that — and about
/// a hunt request being answered *only* when that hunt is switched on.
