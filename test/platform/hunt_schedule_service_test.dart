/// When the hunt's alarm is armed, and when it is deliberately not.
///
/// ## The defect this pins
///
/// F85: the headless hunt re-armed its alarm with the **same** target date,
/// and the re-arm used the first arm's rule — which arms a window that is
/// open *right now*. So the alarm fired at once, the hunt refused, the
/// refusal re-armed again, and the loop ran for as long as the window stayed
/// open: a wake-up every few seconds, each one a round of portal requests.
///
/// The two arms are genuinely different, and this file is where that
/// difference is pinned:
///
///  * the **first** arm is the student's own action, so a window that is
///    open now is a window they mean to hunt in, and it fires at once;
///  * the **re-arm** is automatic and follows a run that has just ended, so
///    it only arms a window that is still ahead.
