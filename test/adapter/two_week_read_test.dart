/// The reservation read must cover **every week a student can hold a meal in**.
///
/// ## The live defect this pins
///
/// Measured live on 2026-10-21 against the real portal:
///
///   * The portal lets a student reserve into the **following week**. The
///     rows two weeks out are every one of them `disabled`; the rows of the
///     week ahead are editable.
///   * The account held a breakfast on 1405/08/03 (2026-10-25) — in week
///     **one**, not week zero.
///   * A read of the current week alone returned **6** reservations. The
///     portal held **7**.
///
/// The seventh was the next-week breakfast, and the read missed it. That is
/// not a cosmetic gap: the mirror falls back to the ledger for a meal the
/// grid did not report, and the ledger records a weekly reservation and a
/// Food Basket purchase the same way — so the meal was filed as an
/// **irreversible basket purchase**. The table showed «خریداری شده» with no
/// cancel button on a meal the portal would have let the student give back,
/// and the one-meal pre-flight check could not see that the slot was taken.
///
/// So the read walks forward a week, and the tests below hold it to that.
