/// The weekly reservation write path, pinned against the portal's real shape.
///
/// ## Why these tests exist
///
/// The write path failed in four distinct ways, and three of them cost the
/// student money:
///
///   * **A next-week booking booked nothing.** The post went against the
///     current week's viewstate, and the viewstate is what decides which
///     week's rows a post affects (F12). The target's row was never in the
///     posted state.
///   * **A booking cancelled the account's other meals.** An ASP.NET checkbox
///     absent from a POST reads as *unchecked*, so posting one row presented
///     every other held row as unchecked.
///   * **A cancel booked unwanted meals.** The portal echoes the checkbox
///     state it was posted, so a row that was never charged comes back
///     `checked`; re-posting that checkbox **books** it (F13).
///   * **A phantom row read as a held meal.** `checked` is not "held", so the
///     app believed it held meals it did not.
///
/// Each test below is checked to fail without its fix.
///
/// ## The dates
///
/// The portal labels its rows in Jalali. The two weeks used here are the ones
/// the live captures carry:
///
///   * current week — `1405/07/25` (2026-10-17) .. `1405/08/01`
///   * next week — `1405/08/02` (2026-10-24) .. `1405/08/08`
///
/// ## The cancel target
///
/// The cancel used to name its meal with a string, `<date>|<slot>`, and the
/// adapter parsed it back. The parse fell through to a default slot when the
/// string did not match, and the app cancelled the **wrong meal** while
/// reporting success (F65). The target is now a [MealRef] — a value — so
/// there is nothing left to misparse.
