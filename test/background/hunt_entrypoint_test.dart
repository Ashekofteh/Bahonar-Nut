/// The headless hunt's decisions.
///
/// ## The defect this pins
///
/// F85: the hunt's alarm fired and the service started, but the Dart engine
/// did not run with the app closed — the request was recorded and the hunt
/// started on the *next launch*. For a 16:30 snipe, "the next launch" is
/// usually after the meal is gone.
///
/// The headless entrypoint is what closes that gap. Its decision to start a
/// hunt is the part that spends money, so it is a pure function and it is
/// tested directly: no engine, no network, no platform.
///
/// The two mistakes that matter are both refusals in one direction and a
/// purchase in the other:
///
///  * a hunt that starts when the student switched it off **spends their
///    money** and burns the account's goodwill with the portal;
///  * a hunt that refuses silently **looks like a broken app** — and a
///    student with no screen to check has no way to tell a refusal from a
///    failure.
