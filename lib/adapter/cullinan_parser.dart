  ///
  ///  * The **weekly menu** (`Reservation.aspx`) names the halls that *serve*
  ///    a meal and the dishes the university offers for it.
  ///  * The **buy page** (`FoodBasketBuy.aspx`) names the halls that have
  ///    *released* a meal into the marketplace.
  ///
  /// The buy page's set is a strict **subset** of the menu's: a hall appears
  /// there only once one of its students has released that meal. So a list
  /// built from the buy page hides every hall that has not yet released
  /// anything — and a hall that has not released anything *yet* is exactly
  /// the one a hunt needs to be able to name, because the market fills up
  /// **during** the hunt window. A "prefer Central, fall back to Engineering"
  /// hunt that could not name Engineering would never use the fallback.
  ///
  /// The hunt's setup therefore reads this page, and the marketplace remains
  /// the source of *listings* only.
  ///
  /// ## The dishes are the same in every hall
  ///
  /// The menu publishes one dish list per (date, slot) and a set of halls that
  /// serve it. The dishes are not per-hall, so this does not build a
  /// hall-to-dish map: the hall list and the dish list are independent, and
