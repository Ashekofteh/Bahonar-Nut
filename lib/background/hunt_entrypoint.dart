/// The headless hunt: the Dart side that runs when the phone is asleep.
///
/// ## Why this file exists
///
/// A hunt is a snipe — a burst of requests against the portal's market during
/// a window of minutes, ending in a purchase. The window is published in
/// advance, and the student is not going to be holding the phone at 16:30.
///
/// So the hunt has to run **without the app being open**. The alarm fires,
/// the native service starts, and this entrypoint is what the service runs.
///
/// ## Why it is its own entrypoint, and not the app's `main`
///
/// The app's `main` calls `runApp`, which builds a widget tree and shows a
/// screen. A background hunt has no screen — and more importantly, it must
/// not have one: a hunt that is waiting for its window can sit for hours, and
/// a widget tree for hours is a memory cost for nothing.
///
/// The native side runs this file by name:
///
/// ```kotlin
/// DartEntrypoint(bundlePath, "package:bahonar_nut/background/hunt_entrypoint.dart", "main")
/// ```
///
/// and passes the account id as the entrypoint's argument.
///
/// ## Why it runs in its own `FlutterEngine`
///
/// Because a *spawned isolate* cannot use the method channel. A spawned
/// isolate's `MethodChannel` resolves to `BackgroundIsolateBinaryMessenger`,
/// which cannot receive messages and throws when a handler is set on it. Only
/// a **root isolate** gets a real `defaultBinaryMessenger`.
///
/// A second `FlutterEngine`'s Dart *is* a root isolate — the engine's
/// `GetRootIsolateToken()` returns a non-zero token for one — so this
/// entrypoint's `MethodChannel` resolves to the background engine's own
/// messenger, and the native side registers a handler there.
///
/// ## What it must not do
///
/// It must not call `startHuntService`. The native service is already
/// running — it is what started this engine. Calling it would re-enter the
/// same service.
