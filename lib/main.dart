// The headless hunt's entrypoint, imported for its existence and nothing else.
//
// The native side starts a second engine and names this file as a **string**;
// no Dart code is supposed to call it. That is exactly the problem: a name
// that exists only in Kotlin is invisible to the Dart compiler, and a library
// that nothing imports is never compiled into the app. The native call then
// asks the VM to run a library that is not there — at 16:30, in the
// background, with no screen to say so.
//
// This import is the only edge that puts the file in the program. The
// function's own `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` is what keeps it, and everything
// it reaches, from being shaken out of a release build.
