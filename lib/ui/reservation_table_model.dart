/// The model behind the reservations table.
///
/// ## Why the table has its own model
///
/// The table answers one question: **what is the state of every meal the
/// student can have, for every day they can still act on?** That is not the
/// same question as "what does the mirror hold" (the reservations screen's
/// question), and it is not the same as "what does the portal serve" (the
/// hunt screen's question).
///
/// So the rows are **built**, not read. A row is a (date, slot) pair with a
/// status derived from three sources:
///
///   * the **menu** — which meals the portal serves, and at what price;
///   * the **mirror** — which of those the student already holds;
///   * the **clock** — which are already past their cutoff.
///
/// ## Why a row can exist without a menu
///
/// A day the portal does not serve still needs to be visible if the student
/// **holds** a meal on it — a basket purchase never appears in the weekly
/// grid (F16), so a menu-only table would hide a meal the student paid for.
/// So a row exists when the portal serves the meal **or** the student holds
/// it.
///
/// ## Why a row does not name a dish
///
/// A menu offers **several** dishes, and the student picks one when they
/// book. So a bookable row says how many options there are and what the
/// cheapest costs — and the dish is chosen in the booking sheet.
///
/// A **held** row names its dish, because that one is decided.
