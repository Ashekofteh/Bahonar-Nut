/// The sheet that asks the student to read the CAPTCHA.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// The app reads the CAPTCHA on the device, and it almost always succeeds. But
/// "almost always" is not "always": the portal may change the image, or the
/// digits may be genuinely ambiguous, and then the solver declines.
///
/// The alternative to asking the student is a login that cannot happen. The
/// login is what every read and every write depends on, and the app's whole
/// purpose is to replace the web portal — so a solver failure that ends the
/// session is a failure of the app, not of the student.
///
/// ## Why the image is shown as it was fetched
///
/// The portal binds the expected answer to the session at **image-fetch
/// time**. The bytes shown here are the bytes that were fetched, and the
/// answer is judged against that challenge. Fetching a fresh image would
/// fetch a *different* challenge, and the answer the student is about to type
/// would be rejected for no reason at all.
///
/// So the image travels with the failure, all the way to here.
///
/// ## What happens when the answer is wrong
///
/// The portal has rotated the challenge by then, so the old image is dead.
/// A fresh one is fetched and shown again, with a message saying the code was
/// not accepted — because "wrong" and "the app cannot read this" are
/// different situations and the student should not have to guess which one
/// they are in.
