/// The top-up (balance recharge) domain: the amount rules, the payment
/// statuses, and the payment list.
///
/// ## Why the amount bounds live here
///
/// The portal accepts a top-up between **120,000 and 5,000,000 Rial**, and
/// refuses anything outside that range **silently** — it re-renders the
/// amount form with no message at all (F56). So the app cannot learn the
/// bounds by asking the portal; it has to know them, and it has to check
/// them *before* the request, or the student gets a button that does
/// nothing.
///
/// The bounds are a rule about the portal's business, not about the UI, so
/// they belong in the core — which is where the architecture test
/// (`test/core/architecture_test.dart`) proves they stay free of Flutter and
/// `dart:io`.
///
/// ## Why the balance is not the proof of payment
///
/// A payment is credited **asynchronously**: the bank gateway returns first,
/// and the portal re-queries the bank afterwards. A balance read taken too
/// early shows the old figure even though the money is on its way. So the
/// portal's own **payment list** is the authority on what happened (F58),
/// and the balance is only refreshed afterwards.
