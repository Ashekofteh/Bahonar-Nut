/// Ranking for the hunt: which market listing, if any, to buy.
///
/// ## Why this is not [PriorityRanker]
///
/// The reservation ranker matches on `(hallId, optionId)`. The hunt cannot,
/// because **the market renumbers option ids**: the same dish on the same
/// date is option `62737` in the weekly reservation grid and option `62798` on
/// the Food Basket buy page — the same name, the same price, a different id.
/// A hunt that matched on ids would therefore never fire on the very dish the
/// user picked.
///
/// So the hunt matches on the **dish name** and applies the **hall** as a
/// separate filter, which is also how the portal models it: the food dropdown
/// lists the dishes on offer and the hall dropdown lists the halls the row is
/// served in (F34, F38).
///
/// ## The ordering
///
/// Dish first, hall second. "Akbar Joojeh in Central, else Akbar Joojeh in
/// Engineering, else the second dish" is the order a user reads their own
/// preference list in, and the order that spends the least money for the most
/// preferred outcome. The two lists are a cartesian product, ordered
/// dish-major.
///
/// ## Everything is a strict whitelist
///
/// The hunt spends real money on an irreversible purchase, so a listing the
/// user did not name is never bought. A dish not on the list is skipped; a
/// hall not on the list is skipped. An empty hall list means "any hall the
/// portal offers", which is the one exception, because there the user has
/// expressed no opinion about halls at all.
