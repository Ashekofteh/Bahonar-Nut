/// The count of requests the app has actually made, per account.
///
/// ## Why this exists, and why it counts requests and not polls
///
/// The portal is shared infrastructure and the user's account is the thing at
/// risk. The project's hard rule is a **per-account request budget** that ends
/// a run when it is exhausted — the last line of defence, below the interval
/// and the jitter.
///
/// That budget used to count **polls**. It was counting the wrong thing. A
/// poll is not a request: reading the basket is a GET plus, when the page's
/// default date is not the one wanted, a date-filter POST; reading the
/// reservations is a GET plus a next-week POST; the portal answers a
/// successful login with a redirect, which is a second request. So a budget
/// of 400 polls was really a budget of 800 requests, and the backstop that
/// exists to prevent a ban was letting through twice the traffic it was
/// written to allow.
///
/// So the count is taken at the only place that knows the truth: the
/// transport, where every request goes. It counts requests, including the
/// redirect hops, because a redirect hop is a request the portal sees.
///
/// ## Why it is per account, and per window
///
/// Accounts are separate: the portal sees one account's traffic, and one
/// account's budget says nothing about another's. The window matters for the
/// same reason the hunt's does — the portal's pressure is a rate, and a
/// count that never resets is not a rate.
///
/// ## What it is not
///
/// It is not a throttle. It does not delay anything and it does not refuse
/// anything: a request that is made is recorded, and the *caller* decides
/// what to do when the budget is gone. The hunt ends its run; a manual
/// refresh is a deliberate act by the student and is allowed to happen. A
/// backstop that silently swallowed a request would produce a read that
/// looks like an empty result, which is the worst shape a limit can have.
