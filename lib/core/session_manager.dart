/// Session lifecycle orchestration.
///
/// Responsibilities, in order of how often they actually matter:
///   1. **Reuse.** A stored session usually still works. Do nothing, spend
///      nothing, involve nobody.
///   2. **Re-authenticate.** When it does not, log in again. The CAPTCHA solver
///      reads the challenge locally, so this is invisible to the user.
///   3. **Serialise.** One login per account at a time. The portal binds the
///      challenge to the session at fetch time, so overlapping logins for the
///      same account would corrupt each other.
///
/// ## The challenge and the session
///
/// The portal judges a CAPTCHA answer against the **session** the image was
/// fetched in, and it mints a new `ASP.NET_SessionId` every time it renders
/// the login page. So the challenge is remembered, and the answer is posted
/// back in the session it came from — which is what lets the student take as
/// long as they like to read four digits, and what keeps an interleaved read
/// from spoiling their answer.
///
/// Verified live 2026-10-21 (F77).
///
/// This class holds no I/O of its own: the [PortalClient] and [SessionStore] are
/// injected, so the whole lifecycle is testable with fakes and a fake clock.
