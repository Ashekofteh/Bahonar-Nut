///
/// That constraint is also why [SessionManager] serialises authentication per
/// account rather than firing logins concurrently.
///
/// The design intent: the common case is that a stored session still works, and

/// ## Why this exists
///
/// The on-device solver reads the CAPTCHA. When it cannot — the portal
/// changed the image, or the digits are ambiguous — the only honest outcome
/// is to **ask the student**, not to fail.
///
/// A failure here is not a cosmetic one. The login is what every read and
/// every write depends on, and the app's whole purpose is to replace the web
/// portal. A student who cannot log in cannot use the app at all.
///
/// ## Why the image travels with the result
///
/// The solver is not the only reader of the CAPTCHA. When it declines, the
/// **image** is what the student needs — and the image is bound to the
/// session at fetch time, so the exact bytes that were fetched are the ones
/// the answer will be judged against. Throwing them away and re-fetching
/// would fetch a *different* challenge, and the typed answer would be
/// rejected for no reason.
///
/// So the image comes with the failure, and the student answers the
/// challenge that is actually live.
///
/// ## Why the session id travels with it too
///
/// The portal mints a new `ASP.NET_SessionId` every time it renders the
/// login page, and the CAPTCHA endpoint sets no cookie of its own. So the
/// challenge lives in the session that was current when the image was
/// fetched, and **any** other request in between replaces that session and
/// makes a correct answer wrong. Verified live 2026-10-21.
///
/// So the session id comes with the failure as well, and the answer is
/// posted back in the session the student actually read.
