/// A [PortalClient] that runs one portal operation at a time per account.
///
/// ## Why the portal needs this
///
/// The portal is ASP.NET WebForms, and the state a POST acts on is carried in
/// the page's `__VIEWSTATE`. The weekly reservation page chains its weeks
/// through that state: a next-week post advances the chain, and the page it
/// returns is the one the next post will be answered against.
///
/// So an operation is **not** one request. Reading the reservations is a GET
/// followed by a next-week POST. Booking is a GET, a write POST, and a
/// confirming GET. Two operations for the same account that overlap can
/// interleave those requests, and the second one then works against a chain
/// the first one has already moved along.
///
/// The failure is silent, and it costs money. A read that lands on the wrong
/// week misses a meal the student holds, and the mirror — which the table,
/// the reminders and the one-meal check are all built on — then says the slot
/// is free. A booking that lands on the wrong week is worse still: the
/// request is accepted, the confirmation reads a different week, and the app
/// reports a failure for a booking that really happened.
///
/// ## Why per account
///
/// The accounts are separate: separate cookies, separate viewstates, separate
/// chains. Two accounts never interfere, and making the second one wait for
/// the first would be a latency the student pays for nothing.
///
/// ## What this does not cover
///
/// The login is two calls — [PortalClient.beginLogin] and
/// [PortalClient.completeLogin] — and a read may run between them.
///
/// That is **not** safe, and the reason is worth stating because it was
/// believed to be the opposite for a long time. The CAPTCHA answer is judged
/// against the **session** the image was fetched in, and the portal mints a
/// new `ASP.NET_SessionId` every time it renders the login page. So an
/// intervening read of the login page replaces that session, and a correct
/// answer is then refused. Verified live 2026-10-21 (F77).
///
/// The answer survives it anyway, because the challenge carries its session id
/// and the client restores it before the POST. What this class must not do is
/// add a **second** challenge fetch to the sequence — that replaces the
/// challenge itself, so the digits the student read would be judged against a
/// challenge that is not theirs.
