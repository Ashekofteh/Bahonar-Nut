/// ## Why the password is not on [SavedAccount]
///
/// [SavedAccount] is the *identity* of an account: a student id, a display
/// name, when it was added. It is safe to keep in plain storage and safe to
/// show in a list.
///
/// The password is different. It never appears in the account list, never goes
/// into the plain store, and lives only in the Keystore. Keeping it in a
/// separate type makes the boundary visible in the type system rather than in
/// a comment.
