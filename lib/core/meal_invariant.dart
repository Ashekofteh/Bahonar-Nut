///
/// Verified live (2026-10-19, F21/F22):
///
///   * The basket's food dropdown is **not** filtered by what the student
///     already holds. For 1405/07/30 the basket offered option 62759 — the
///     exact meal the account already held weekly — for the same date and slot.
///   * The **server does not enforce the rule either**. A POST attempting to
///     buy the already-held meal returned 200, an empty alert box, no state
///     change, and no charge.
///
/// So the rule is entirely the app's responsibility. Without this guard the app
/// could buy a second meal for a slot the student already reserved — and
/// because a basket purchase is **irreversible**, that is money spent on a meal
/// the student cannot collect and cannot cancel.
///
/// ## The rule
///
/// For a given (date, slot) pair, a student may hold **at most one** meal, from
/// either source, and never both.
