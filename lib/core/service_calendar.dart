/// Which meals the university dining halls actually serve, by weekday.
///
/// Verified against two consecutive weeks of live portal grids (1405/07/25–08/01
/// and 1405/08/02–08/08), which agreed exactly:
///
/// | Weekday   | Breakfast | Lunch | Dinner |
/// |-----------|-----------|-------|--------|
/// | Saturday  |    no     |  yes  |  yes   |
/// | Sunday    |    yes    |  yes  |  yes   |
/// | Monday    |    yes    |  yes  |  yes   |
/// | Tuesday   |    yes    |  yes  |  yes   |
/// | Wednesday |    yes    |  yes  |  yes   |
/// | Thursday  |    yes    |  yes  |   no   |
/// | Friday    |    no     |  no   |   no   |
///
/// **Why Saturday and Friday breakfast are absent** (the pattern is wider than
/// the stated rule, and this is why): breakfast is collected together with the
/// *previous* night's dinner. Friday has no dinner, so Saturday has no breakfast;
/// Thursday has no dinner, so Friday has no breakfast. The rule and the table
/// describe one system.
///
/// **Advisory only.** The portal's own grid is authoritative whenever a read
/// succeeds. This table exists so a 10:30 alarm is not scheduled on a Friday and
/// so a closed slot never produces a reminder. Where they disagree, the portal
/// wins. Two weeks is a strong sample but holidays can perturb it, which is
/// exactly why the calendar never overrides a live read.
