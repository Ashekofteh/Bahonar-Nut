/// The local store of held meals — the source of truth for offline reminders.
///
/// ## Why it exists
///
/// The reminder feature must work **offline**: firing a notification should
/// never require logging into the portal. So the app keeps a local mirror of
/// what each account holds, updated whenever the app does something (a
/// booking, a basket purchase, a cancellation) and refreshed opportunistically
/// when a live session is available.
///
/// The live portal check remains available as an **opt-in** setting, off by
/// default. When it is on, the reminder reconciles against the portal before
/// sending; when it is off, it reads only the local store.
///
/// ## Retention
///
/// A meal only matters until the end of the week it belongs to. Once a week has
/// passed the record is obsolete: the meal was eaten, missed, or expired, and
/// the portal will not let it be used again. Keeping those records forever is
/// storage bloat with no possible use, so the store prunes them.
///
/// Pruning is by **date**, not by insertion time, so a record's lifetime is
/// determined by the week it describes rather than by when the app happened to
/// cache it.
