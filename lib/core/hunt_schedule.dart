/// When a hunt actually runs: the date its window belongs to, and the instant
/// the hunt should wake up.
///
/// ## Why the window needs a date, not just a time of day
///
/// A hunt's window is a *time of day* — "from 16:30 to 20:30". That is enough
/// to decide **how hard** to poll, but not enough to decide **when to start**.
/// A hunt set up on Wednesday morning for *Friday's* dinner has a window that
/// opens on Friday, not on Wednesday — but a time-of-day window read on
/// Wednesday says "16:30 is later today, so the window is still to come", and
/// the hunt would burn its request budget against a market it can never buy
/// from.
///
/// So the window is resolved against a **collection date**, and the resolution
/// has one wrinkle the portal's own calendar imposes:
///
/// **Breakfast is collected with the previous evening's dinner.** A hunt for
/// Friday's breakfast has to be in the market on *Thursday* evening, because
/// that is when the meal is released and taken. The offset is therefore
/// derived from the serving calendar rather than assumed, and the
/// [ServiceCalendar] already encodes it: Thursday has no dinner, so Friday has
/// no breakfast, and Saturday has no breakfast because Friday has no dinner.
///
/// ## Why the wake instant is the window's *start*
///
/// The hunt is worth running from the moment the window opens — every minute
/// before the first listing appears is a minute of not winning it. So the
/// wake instant is the window's start on the collection date, in the portal's
/// own timezone: a portal-local wall-clock time is a UTC instant only once the
/// portal's offset is subtracted, and getting that wrong by 3½ hours would
/// start the hunt before the market opens.

  ///
  /// [clockIsSynced] says whether [nowUtc] is the **portal's** time. When it
  /// is not, the caller is passing the device's time as a stand-in, and the
  /// device's timezone may be anything at all — so the question "has the
  /// window already closed?" cannot be answered from it.
  ///
  /// So an unsynced clock never produces [HuntScheduleStatus.windowPassed].
  /// The hunt is scheduled instead, and the alarm fires: if the window has in
  /// fact passed, the hunt's own date-aware window check refuses it, and the
  /// refusal is visible. Cancelling the alarm instead would make the hunt
  /// silently never run — the exact failure F83 is about.

  /// dangerous direction. The first arm is the student's own action: a window
  /// that is open now is a window they mean to hunt in, so it fires at once.
  /// A re-arm is automatic, and the run it follows has just ended — usually
  /// because the hunt **refused** (no credit, no session) or ran out of its
  /// request budget. Re-arming into the same open window would start the hunt
  /// again immediately, and it would refuse again, and again: a tight loop of
  /// wake-ups, each one a round of portal requests, for as long as the window
  /// stayed open.
  ///
  /// That is exactly what the request budget exists to prevent, so a re-arm
  /// asks only for a window that is still **ahead**. When the wake instant
  /// has passed, the result is [HuntScheduleStatus.windowOpen]: the hunt is
  /// over for this window, and the student chooses a new date.

  /// and "now". So "now" has to be the portal's now, and an unsynced clock
  /// cannot supply it. The caller checks that, because only the caller knows
  /// whether the clock is trusted. Here the clock is declared synced, because
  /// the caller would not have called a re-arm at all with a clock it does not
  /// trust.
  ///
  /// ## How this differs from the first arm, mechanically

  /// what the *caller* does with it. An opened window is
  /// [HuntScheduleStatus.windowOpen], and [HuntScheduleResult.isScheduled] is

  /// nothing. The first arm deliberately arms it anyway (see
