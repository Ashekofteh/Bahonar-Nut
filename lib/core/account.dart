/// A saved account, and how its display name is resolved.
///
/// ## The name chain
///
/// The user may give an account a nickname. If they do not, the app falls back
/// to the student's real name as the portal knows it. If that is not known
/// either, it falls back to the student ID.
///
/// The chain is **alias -> profile name -> student ID**, and it never yields an
/// empty string. The student ID is captured at save time, so an account that
/// has never been logged in — and therefore has no profile name yet — still
/// displays something meaningful rather than a blank row.
///
/// ## Why the profile name is not available offline
///
/// The portal reveals `divUsername` only on authenticated pages. So a freshly
/// added account has no profile name until its first successful login. The
/// fallback exists precisely for that window, and the chain must not be
/// "optimised" into assuming a profile name is always there.
