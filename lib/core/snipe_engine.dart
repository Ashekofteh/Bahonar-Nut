///   1. Preflight, before the loop. Never discover a dead session mid-hunt.
///   2. Poll, then filter tombstoned listings, then rank. A dead listing must
///      never reach the ranker, because a match on a dead listing costs a claim
///      attempt that looks like a retry attack.
///   3. One in-flight claim, ever. Serialised per account.
///   4. On ambiguity, reconcile — never retry. This is the double-purchase guard.
///
/// Fully testable with fakes: the client, clock and sleep are all injected, so
/// the whole hunt runs deterministically in milliseconds.
