/// The next-week nudge's schedule: when to check, and when to stop checking.
///
/// ## Why this is a pure function
///
/// The nudge is a **sequence of checks**, not a single alarm. The product
/// owner specified six: Wednesday noon, Wednesday afternoon, Wednesday night,
/// Thursday morning, Thursday noon, and Thursday afternoon/evening.
///
/// Taken at face value that fires even when the week is already booked, which
/// trains the user to ignore the notification. The resolution the spec settled
/// on: the six times are **check times**, and a check fires only if something
/// is still unbooked.
///
/// So the schedule itself is arithmetic — which weekday, which hour, is it
/// still ahead — and it belongs in the domain where it can be tested against
/// every boundary without a device.
