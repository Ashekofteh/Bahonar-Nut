/// The meal-spend metric behind the finance dashboard.
///
/// ## What the metric is
///
/// The sum of the **monetary price of the meals actually held**, per the
/// product owner's definition. It is NOT a money-in/money-out ledger: top-ups
/// and withdrawals of credit are a different thing, and are excluded.
///
/// ## The counting rule, and why a naive sum is wrong
///
/// The portal's transaction history is an **event log**, not a set of
/// possessions. The same (date, slot) can appear several times:
///
/// ```
/// 1405/07/30 lunch -> [رزرو غذا, انصراف از رزرو غذا, رزرو غذا]
/// ```
///
/// That is: booked, released, booked again. Summing every booking row would
/// count that lunch **twice**, and would count a meal that was later released
/// as still held.
///
/// The rule: **for each (account, date, slot), only the most recent event
/// counts.** If that event is a booking, the meal is held and its amount is
/// included; if it is a withdrawal, the meal was given up and is excluded.
///
/// Document order is recency order — verified against the live ledger, where
/// the newest transaction (1405/08/03, a future date) appears second, not
/// last. So "most recent" means "first in document order", not "last".
///
/// ## One caveat the UI should not overclaim
///
/// The ledger records meals **reserved**. It does not record whether the meal
/// was **eaten**. A meal reserved and then forgotten is counted here, and the
/// portal separately charges a penalty for it. So this metric is best labelled
/// "meals reserved" rather than "money spent" — the number is the cost of the
/// meals held, not a bank statement.
