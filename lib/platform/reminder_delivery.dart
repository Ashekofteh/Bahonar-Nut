/// Turning a fired reminder alarm into a notification.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// The alarm is scheduled by the platform and fires with the app in the
/// background — or with the app not running at all. Something has to be
/// listening for the fire and posting the digest, and that something has to
/// work without the user having opened the app.
///
/// Two paths, deliberately:
///
///   * **The process is alive** (the app is open, or was backgrounded): the
///     platform's method channel carries the fired payload, and this
///     coordinator delivers the digest and re-arms the slot for tomorrow.
///   * **The process is dead** (the app was killed): the alarm cannot reach
///     Dart at all, so the native side **records the delivery** and the Dart
///     side picks it up the next time it runs.
///
/// The second path is the one that matters most: a reminder whose whole job
/// is to protect a cutoff cannot depend on the student having opened the app.
///
/// ## Why the dead-process path is a record and not a delivery
///
/// The digest is composed in Dart, from the local meal mirror, so there is
/// nothing to deliver from the native side. But there is also nothing to
/// *lose* from the native side: the receiver writes the payload to a place
/// that survives the process, and the Dart side delivers it when it next
/// runs. A reminder that was owed is never forgotten.
///
/// The alternative — starting a Flutter engine inside the receiver — would
/// deliver the digest at the exact minute even with the app killed. It is
/// also a much larger machine: an engine, an isolate, the whole platform
/// bridge, in a broadcast receiver. The record is the smaller thing that
/// keeps the promise, and it is honest about what it is: the digest arrives
/// when the student next opens the app, rather than never.
