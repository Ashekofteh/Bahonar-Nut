/// Reserving and cancelling a weekly meal.

/// ## Why this is a service and not a screen
///
/// A reservation is a **write** to the portal, and it is not undoable by
/// simply forgetting it: once the cutoff passes, the meal is committed and
/// cannot be given back. So the decision to book lives in the platform layer,
/// where it can be checked against the one-meal rule and the account's
/// balance **before** the request goes out, and where the outcome is
/// established by reading the portal back rather than by trusting the
/// response.
///
/// The write path itself is proven — a live book-and-cancel cycle (F14) and a
/// live basket purchase (F16) — so what was missing was not the ability to
/// reserve but any way for the user to ask for it.
