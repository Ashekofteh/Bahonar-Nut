/// Starting a top-up, and settling it once the student has paid.
///
/// ## Why this is a service and not a screen
///
/// A top-up spends the student's **own money**, and the portal's own rules
/// are unforgiving in a way that has to be handled before the request:
///
///   * the amount is refused **silently** outside 120,000–5,000,000 Rial
///     (F56), so the app checks the bounds itself;
///   * one of the two banks the portal lists is **not configured** and errors
///     (F57), so the app does not offer it;
///   * the payment is credited **asynchronously** (F58), so the balance read
///     right after the handoff is not the answer — the portal's payment list
///     is.
///
/// So the decision to charge lives in the platform layer, where it can be
/// checked against the balance and the bounds **before** the request goes
/// out, and where the outcome is established by reading the portal back
/// rather than by trusting the response.
