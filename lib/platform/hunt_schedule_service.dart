/// Keeps the hunt's wake-up armed, and says when the hunt will start.
///
/// ## Why the alarm is armed here, and not by the hunt
///
/// The hunt's wake-up is what makes the card's claim true: «این شکار روشن است
/// و هنگام بازه زمانی خود شروع می‌شود» — "this hunt is on and starts by
/// itself during its time window". Before F83 nothing armed any hunt alarm
/// at all, so the switch was a switch with no consequence and the claim was
/// false.
///
/// The alarm is armed from the **configuration**, not from the hunt. The hunt
/// is a run; the alarm is a promise about the future. So the promise is made
/// when the configuration changes, and it is kept when the device reboots
/// (which clears every alarm) — the same way the reminder alarms are.
///
/// ## Why the schedule is derived rather than configured
///
/// The student does not choose *when* the hunt starts; they choose a date, a
/// meal and a window, and the start follows from those. That derivation lives
/// in `lib/core` (see [HuntSchedules]) so it can be tested on the VM, and this
/// class only moves the resulting instant across the platform boundary.

  /// Arms the hunt's wake-up again, after a run has ended.
  ///
  /// ## Why the re-arm is not the first arm
  ///
  /// The first arm is the student's own action, so a window that is open now
  /// is a window they mean to hunt in and it fires at once. A re-arm follows
  /// a run that has just ended — usually because the hunt **refused** (no
  /// credit, no session) or ran out of its request budget — and arming into
  /// the same open window would start the hunt again immediately, and again,
  /// for as long as the window stayed open.
  ///
  /// So the re-arm only arms a window that is still **ahead**. A window that
  /// has opened is reported as [HuntScheduleStatus.windowOpen] and no alarm
  /// is set: the hunt has had its chance at that window, and the student
  /// chooses a new date.
  ///
  /// ## The clock must be synced
  ///
  /// The comparison is between a portal-derived instant and "now", so "now"
  /// has to be the portal's now. An unsynced clock cannot supply it, so the
  /// re-arm is refused rather than guessed: a re-arm that fires at once is
  /// the failure this exists to prevent.
