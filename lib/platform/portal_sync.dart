/// Reading the portal and refreshing the local mirror.

/// bridge between "the portal knows something" and "the app knows something".
///
/// ## Why the sync is explicit rather than automatic
///
/// Every portal read costs a request, and a request pattern is the thing most
/// likely to get an account flagged. So the sync happens:
///   * when the user asks for it (pull to refresh), and
///   * when the app does something itself (a booking, a purchase, a cancel).
///
/// It is never a background poll. The sniping engine polls the **basket**, not
/// the account, and only inside a hunting window.
