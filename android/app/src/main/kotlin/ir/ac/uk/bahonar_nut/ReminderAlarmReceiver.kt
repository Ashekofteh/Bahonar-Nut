/**
 * Receives the reminder alarm and hands it to the Dart side.
 *
 * ## Two different alarms, two different destinations
 *
 * The app arms two kinds of alarm, and they are not the same thing:
 *
 *  * A **reminder** alarm (`lunch`, `evening`) asks the Dart side to deliver
 *    a digest. The digest is composed in Dart, from the local meal mirror, so
 *    the receiver hands the payload to the engine and stops.
 *  * A **hunt** wake-up starts the hunt's foreground service, which keeps the
 *    process alive for the length of the hunt.
 *
 * Treating a reminder as a hunt wake-up would post the "monitoring the food
 * basket" notification and leave a foreground service running with no hunt
 * behind it — a stuck notification the user cannot clear.
 *
 * ## Why the payload is recorded before it is handed over
 *
 * The alarm fires when the app may not be running, and the digest lives in
 * Dart. So the payload is written to [PendingDelivery] **first**, and only
 * then handed to the Dart side.
 *
 * The order matters. Handing it over first would lose the delivery whenever
 * the process was dead — the channel is a static field the activity
 * populates, so with a dead process the call was a no-op and the reminder
 * was dropped without a sound. Recording first means the delivery is owed
 * either way: the Dart side delivers it now if it is alive, and the record
 * is still there for it to pick up if it is not.
