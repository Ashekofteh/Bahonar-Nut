/**
 * The foreground service that keeps a hunt alive.
 *
 * ## Why a foreground service at all
 *
 * A hunt is a burst of network requests over a window of minutes, and it has
 * to survive the screen going off and the device dozing. A background
 * `WorkManager` job is not enough: the system may defer it past the very
 * cutoff it is trying to hit. A foreground service is the only mechanism
 * Android offers that is reliably exempt from Doze.
 *
 * ## Why it is released promptly
 *
 * The spec is explicit: the service is released the moment the window closes
 * or a purchase lands. A foreground service that lingers is a battery drain
 * and a user-visible notification that will not go away, so `stopForeground`
 * is called on every exit path, including the failure ones.
 *
 * The service itself holds no logic. It keeps the process alive and asks the
 * Dart side to run; every decision about *whether* to buy belongs to the
 * domain core.
