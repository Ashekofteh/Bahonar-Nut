/**
 * Schedules the reminder alarms.
 *
 * ## Why exact alarms
 *
 * A reminder at 10:30 that arrives at 11:20 is useless, and the window it
 * guards closes at 20:00 the same day. `AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`
 * is the only API that fires at the requested minute, including in Doze.
 *
 * The permission (`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, Android 12+) is requested **with an
 * explanation**, never silently: the user is told that exact timing is what
 * makes the reminder useful, and that the alternative — inexact alarms — can be
 * delayed by hours and may miss a cutoff entirely.
 *
 * ## The catch-up
 *
 * Exact alarms are lost when the device is off. A `WorkManager` job is
 * scheduled alongside as a backstop, and a boot receiver re-arms everything.
 * Without that, a phone that was off at 20:00 would silently fail to reserve
 * the weekend's meals.

     * Schedules the hunt's wake-up for [accountId] at [triggerAtMillis].
     *
     * ## Why the hunt has its own action
     *
     * The reminder alarms and the hunt alarms are different things, and the
     * receiver has to tell them apart *before* the Dart side can be asked. The
     * reminder alarms carry a payload the Dart side defines ("lunch",
     * "evening", "nudge"); the hunt's carries an account id. Guessing from
     * the payload's shape would mean a payload the app did not recognise was
     * treated as a hunt — so the action says which it is, and the payload
     * only says which account.
     *
     * ## Why the account is in the intent's data, not only in its extra
     *
     * A `PendingIntent` is identified by its request code **and** its intent's
     * action, data, type and component — but not by its extras. So two
     * accounts' hunt alarms, sharing a request code and an intent, would be
     * the *same* pending intent: arming the second would silently replace
     * the first, and cancelling one would cancel both.
     *
     * Putting the account in the data URI makes each account's alarm a
     * distinct pending intent, so each can be armed, replaced and cancelled
     * on its own. The request code is then the same for all of them, and the
     * data does the distinguishing.
